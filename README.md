# Lawgic: Your Reliable Partner
Welcome to the our project, we Team "BadallWAlle" are delighted to have you here!
It's a solution for a problem statement provided in GenAI Hackathon which is using "Generative AI for Demystifying Legal Documents"

## Overview
This project rose from the need of understanding Legal documents—such as rental agreements, loan contracts, and terms of service—are often filled with complex, impenetrable jargon that is incomprehensible to the average person. This creates a significant information asymmetry, where individuals may unknowingly agree to unfavorable terms, exposing them to financial and legal risks. There is a pressing need for a tool that can bridge this gap, making essential legal information accessible and understandable to everyone, from everyday citizens to small business owners. Here comes "Lawgic", an AI-Powered application that helps its users with legal documents! It's main task is to provide its users clear summaries, explaination of complex clauses, and answering user queries in a simple, yet practical manner which empowers them to make clear, sound and informed decisions thereby empowering them.

## Features
Some of the Lawgic amazing abilities are:
- Providing end to end conversation encryption.
- Find faults within case documents in accordance to "Indian Laws".
- Summarizing the case and translates it into simple language.
- Allows user to use its insights to make basic judgements from case in respect to the user's queries.
